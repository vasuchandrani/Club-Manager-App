# 📱 Club-Manager-App

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Clubs in colleges often struggle to inform students about events, recruitments, and other updates. Sending emails to every student is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Additionally, students receive irrelevant mails from clubs they have no interest in, leading to overcrowded inboxes and missed opportunities.

- 📬 Clubs to post announcements in-app.
- 👩‍🎓 Students to view updates only from clubs they’re interested in.
